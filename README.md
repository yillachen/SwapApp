# Swap App

## Getting started

1. Fork and clone this repo.
2. `npm install`.
3. Create `swap` and `swap_test` databases.
4. Start the build process and your application with: `npm run start-dev`. If you're using Windows, you may need to execute `npm run start-server` and `npm run build-watch` separately (in their own terminal tabs).
5. Run the tests with: `npm test`. Working through the tests is a good place to start!
6. Check out the starting seed file in `seed.js` - you can run it by executing `npm run seed`. You will need to seed the database once you've set up the Sequelize models.
